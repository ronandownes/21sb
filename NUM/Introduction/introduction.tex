\chap{Introduction to the  Number Strand}

\label{chap:NUMintro}







This strand takes a fresh perspective  on the ideas and skills about number that
you developed in primary school.   
% the transition between arithmetic and algebra; the
% Common Introductory Course provides appropriate
% continuity with, and progression from, primary school
% mathematics. Within this strand, in the context of learning
% about numbers and computation, learners explore and
% investigate some generalisations that are central to our
% number system, the properties and relationships of binary
% operations, and the results of operating on particular
% kinds of numbers. Learners are introduced to the notion
% of justification or proof. They extend their work with ratios
% to develop an understanding of proportionality which can
% be applied to solve single and multi-step problems in
% numerous contexts. Learners are expected to be able to
% use calculators appropriately and accurately, as well as
% carrying out calculations by hand and mentally
